Write a shell script that prompts the user to enter a number. Check if the number is either between 20 and 30 (inclusive) or less than 10, and is not equal to 2. Display "Number meets the criteria" if both conditions are true. Otherwise, display "Number does not meet the criteria." [ using && (And) || (OR) ]



#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
if { [$num -ge 20] && [$num -le 30] || [$num -lt 10]; }
     && [$num -ne 2]; then
    echo "Number meets the criteria."
else
    echo "Number does not meet the criteria."
fi




#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter a number: " num
if { [ $num -ge 20 ] && [ $num -le 30 ]; } || [ $num -lt 10 ]; then
    echo "Number meets the criteria"
else
    echo "Number does not meet theÂ criteria"
fi

 



Write a shell script that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5.


#!/bin/bash
num=1
while [ $num -le 5 ]; do
    echo $num
    num=$((num + 1))
done



Write a shell script that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20.

#!/bin/bash
for num in {1..20}; do
    echo $num
done



#!/bin/bash
for ((num=1; num <=20; num++)); do
    echo $num
done



Write a shell script that uses nested for loops to generate and print a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5.


#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    for j in {1..5}; do
        echo -n "$((i * j)) "
    done
    echo
done




Select loop with cases:

select variable in alal dulal Rahim
do
  case $variable in
    alal) #Case alal
      echo "Alal is selected"
    ;;
    dulal) #Case dulal
      echo "Dulal is selected"
    ;;
    rahim) #Case rahim
      echo "Rahim is selected"
    ;;
    *) #Default case
      echo "Default"
    ;;
  esac
done

(Now press CTRL+C to exit)




#!/bin/bash
a=0
until [ ! $a -ge 10 ]; do
     echo $a
     a=$((a + 1))
done
